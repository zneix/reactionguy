_private discord bot made by zneix for Kappa Discord_

---

* .rar package contains everything needed to run the bot
* source code can be used to run bot as well, but you need to install *discord.js* package first with `npm i discord.js` command within source code folder

---

How to run it (using ready .rar package):
1. Unpack the .rar package in new folder
2. Make sure you have installed npm on your workstation (run `npm -v` in terminal to check it)
3. Open up terminal and navigate to folder containing unpacked files
4. Run `node .` command

if you see `connected, logged in as...` in your terminal it means, that bot is running properly
